javascript implementation of conways game of life

Click on any grid to make it 'live' or 'dead', then click 'start'

For a reminder of the rules of Conway's Game of Life:

    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Good luck! Try it at http://zkytony.com/codings/life
